## THE MAGNIFICENT, UNRIVALED, GENIUS LICENSE (M.U.G.L.)

In my infinite benevolence and unmatched generosity, I hereby grant you, the unworthy but lucky user, the following rights:

DO WHATEVER THE HECK YOU WANT 

Copy it, paste it, tweak it, twist it, sell it, eat it for breakfast (metaphorically), or use it to impress your friends at parties. Modify it to your heart's content—heck, make it better if you dare (though I doubt you can top this perfection).

No need to credit me (though if you do, make sure to call me "The Magnificent One" and bow three times). No warranties, no guarantees— if it breaks your computer, turns your cat into a dog, or causes world peace, that's on you. I disclaim all responsibility because, let's face it, my code is flawless.

By using this code, you agree to occasionally whisper to yourself, "Wow, this is the best code ever," and acknowledge that no other license is as hilariously superior as this one.

This license is eternal, unbreakable, and way cooler than those boring MIT or GPL things. If anyone questions it, tell them to take it up with the Code Gods.

P.S. If you make a billion dollars from this, buy me a coffee. Or a yacht. Your call.
