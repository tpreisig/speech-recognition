The current file script.js is implementing a simple speech recognition application using the Web Speech API. Here's a brief overview of what the script does:

It initializes the Web Speech API components (SpeechRecognition, SpeechGrammarList, and SpeechRecognitionEvent).
It sets up the speech recognition instance with specific configurations such as language, grammar, and result handling.
It dynamically generates a list of colors and displays them as hints on the webpage.
It starts the speech recognition process when the user clicks anywhere on the body of the document.
It processes the recognized speech to change the background color of the webpage based on the spoken color.
The Web Speech API provides two main functionalities:

Speech Recognition: Allows web applications to convert voice input into text.
Speech Synthesis: Allows web applications to convert text into spoken voice.
